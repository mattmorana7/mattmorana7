## About Me

Hello! My name is Matt Morana. I am completing my Master of Business Administration degree with a concentration in Business Analytics from Lehigh University in August 2022. I also attended Lehigh University for my undergraduate degree in the class of 2019, where I majored in Supply Chain Management and minored in Business Information Systems and International Relations. During undergrad, I was a member of Lehigh's Division I varsity soccer team and a two-year captain. In between my two degrees at Lehigh, I worked at Deloitte in New York City as an Engagement Financial Advisor, directly supporting Partners and Senior Managers during every step of the Consulting engagement life cycle, from developing the initial pricing model, to recurring updates throughout the project, to issuing the final invoice.

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](midterm/analysis_report.md)**_

After downloading all 10-Ks from S&P 500 firms in 2019, this project analyzed 5 different risks by identifying keywords through natural language processing. Then, the weekly returns at the start of COVID-19 (March 9-13, 2020) were compared to the counts of those keywords to determine if there was a relationship between risks and returns.

## Career Objectives

I have a strong interest in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and would especially like to work in an M&A consulting role after my program. I was introduced to the world of M&A in my previous job at Deloitte, and the MBA program has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in its most distinguished course, the Consulting Practicum. As part of the Practicum, I am currently working on a consulting engagement for a Microsoft Independent Software Vendor based in New York City who would like to acquire a company in an adjacent space to the work they already do (such as cybersecurity, training, compliance, etc.). Our final product will be a 4-part deliverable for our client:  1.) an M&A strategy that focuses on specific target companies we identify through market research and analysis; 2.) an action plan which includes recommendations/rationale on how best to organize and deploy resources to achieve our target; 3.) an integration plan giving emphasis to organizational design (taking into consideration whether an acquisition should be viewed as a “bolt-on” to the product line or represents a new division or relates to the formation of a stand-alone subsidiary company); and 4.) a balanced scorecard which translates strategic objectives into a set of performance metrics that will be routinely populated and monitored to measure progress and support decision-making.

## Hobbies

I am from Massachusetts so I love following Boston sports teams. I also enjoy walking my two Golden Retrievers, hiking, kayaking, and traveling to explore new places.
